(23) linked progesterone resistance to autonomously activated KRAS.Overall progesterone receptor (PGR) levels have been reported to be lower in adenomyosis compared to normal endometrium (48) ; however, we here identified higher PGR expression in distinct populations of fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue than in endometrium and myometrium, suggesting that progesterone resistance at the level of stromal cells is mediated by complex cellular and molecular mechanisms (Supplemental Fig. 6 , available online).On the other hand, epithelial cells in adenomyotic tissue showed downregulation of PAEP compared with epithelial cells in endometrium; PAEP is an important progesterone-responsive gene (45, 46) .This is suggestive that progesterone action in the context of a stromal-epithelial paracrine interaction may be deficient in adenomyosis (5, 39) .",
