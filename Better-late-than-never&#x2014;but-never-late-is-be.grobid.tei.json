(1) , is defined as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation followed by the in vitro maturation of immature oocytes at time of retrieval (2) .Rescue IVM does not require any changes in stimulation protocol and can be easily used in any standard IVF cycle.",

(1) , they compared MII and rescued MI-MII sister oocytes and allowed between 1 and 6 hours for progression to MII stage.They performed ICSI on the MI-MII oocytes at time intervals of 1-1.5 hours, 2-2.5 hours, and 3-6 hours after polar body extrusion.They found that only 25% of oocytes injected 1-1.5 hours after reaching the MII stage fertilized normally; 43% after 2-2.5 hours, 59% after 3-3.5 hours, and 62% after 4-6 hours (5) .Oocytes in the Moon et al. (1) , study were reassessed 2-6 hours after retrieval and underwent ICSI at the time maturity was observed via polar body extrusion.If cytoplasmic maturity indeed lags behind nuclear maturity by several hours, perhaps the single time point of 6 hours after retrieval would be sufficient to optimize nuclear and cytoplasmic maturity of the oocytes, leading to potential increased fertilization and blastulation per oocyte after ICSI.",
