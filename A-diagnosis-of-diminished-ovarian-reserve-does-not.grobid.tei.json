(5) was one of the first to use chromosome screening to address this issue.In this study, aneuploidy rates in DOR patients were increased.However, patients in the DOR group were older than the patients in the control group.Additionally, the PGT screening was done under strict environments and was not broadly implemented throughout all infertility diagnoses, making the control group different from the actual population seeking IVF treatment.Researchers have attempted to challenge the paradigm of reduced egg quality of patients with DOR in other studies and have based their conclusions on examining AMH and FSH levels before IVF treatment, ovarian response to stimulation, and other potential surrogates of the ongoing cycle (9, 26) .",

(6) , in which blastocysts from women with DOR were reported to be less likely euploid, which might have resulted because of different study populations and the statistical methodological differences between our studies.First, we excluded women >40 years of age from the analysis, as our interest group consisted of younger patients.This is also in line with recommended criteria for assessing DOR patients (28, 29) .With the use of the SART age group classification to match the ages of patients with DOR and controls, Jaswa et al. (6) reported that the composite average euploid rate in women with DOR and non-DOR differed significantly.However, the overall age group differences in their cohort also differed (39.5 and 37.0; P< .01).In contrast, these changes were not reported as significant in a subgroup comparison, and similar aneuploidy rates were reported in their peers in the SART age groups, specifically in groups A and B, in patients<37 years of age.Our findings regarding aneuploidy rates in patients<40 years of age in both DOR and POR patients, are consistent with these results, in accordance with those found by Morin et al. (4) .Other methodological differences were using the Bologna criteria for the diagnosis of DOR by Jaswa et al. (15) and the inclusion of patients naive to previous IVF cycles.Hence, we could not use the previous POR criteria (17) .Shahine et al. (16) recently found a significantly higher rate of aneuploid embryos together with a higher rate of cycles with ''no euploid embryos'' to transfer in DOR patients with unexplained RPL compared with control patients with normal ovarian reserve.However, the cohort of patients with RPL in that study is clinically different from our study population and likely represents a subgroup of DOR patients with higher aneuploidy rates compared with a general cohort of DOR patients.Similar to Shahine et al. ( 16), we have also observed an increased rate of ''no euploid embryos'' to transfer in both the DOR and POR groups, which might be because of the overall reduction in developing embryos in these groups.",
